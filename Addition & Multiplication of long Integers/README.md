# Long Integer Addition and Multiplication

This program performs addition and multiplication operations on long integers.

## Code

The code is written in C and consists of the following functions:

`multiply(int l1, int l2, char *longint1, char *longint2, char *mul)`: This function multiplies two long integers represented as strings.

`add_int(int l1, int l2, char *longint1, char *longint2, char *add)`: This function adds two long integers represented as strings.

The main program prompts the user to enter two long integers and then calls the `add_int` and `multiply` functions to perform the addition and multiplication operations, respectively. The results are printed to the console.

## Usage

> Compile the code using a C compiler.
> 
> Run the executable.
> 
> Enter the first long integer when prompted.
> 
> Enter the second long integer when prompted.
> 
> The program will display the addition result and the multiplication result.


## Example

```

Enter the first long int:
12345678901234567890
Enter the second long int:
98765432109876543210
Addition result:
111111111011111111100
Multiplication result:
1219326311370217958936222227465397268890000
